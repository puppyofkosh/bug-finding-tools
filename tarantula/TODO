-get rid of project_name, version pair BS

Ideas from meeting 4/4
-incrementally build set of passing tests to provide labels
-just optimize whole function of how thing performs

-try using only 1 failing test case

3 things to work on:
  invariants (hold off for now)
  test filtering
       -try 1, 1/2, 1/3 idea
       Maybe do bug finding line by line on siemens program input (the inputs lines
       are often independent)
       -Read paper 66 and implement heuristics
       -Try to find a classifier that does well on one input and figure out
       why it does well on that input
       -Run feature selection on current features
       -Come up with more binary spectrum features
       -Use "ulam" distance and nonbinary spectrum features
  

-investigate idea of changing branch suspiciousness to be the max of its two branches.

How badly do the branch examples do?


-Try using intersection of statements executed by failing test cases
-use function optimizer
-implement tarantula in cpp
