To set up daikon follow the instructions here:
http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/developer.html

Install the packages, and pull from their git repo here:
https://github.com/codespecs/daikon

Do 
$ make compile

# I have to do this after the first time I compile
$ make very-clean

# Then
$ make daikon.jar

There are some instructions in the daikon/README.source which can be helpful too, but mainly follow the guide above
